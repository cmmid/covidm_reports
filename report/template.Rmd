# Overview

This report provides modelled projections of COVID-19 epidemics in `r params$location` under different intervention scenarios. We use a population of `r mk(sum(params$poppyra$pop))` in `r params$location`, with an average age of `r signif(params$poppyra[, sum(per_by_group[-.N]*seq(2,by=5,length.out = .N-1))+per_by_group[.N]*87.5], 3)`, based on [@wpp;@wpprepo].

- We use a transmission model to project the COVID-19 epidemic in `r params$location`; it accounts for the local age structure, as well as uncertainty in transmission due to uncertainty in $R_0$ and randomness in the process.
- We consider an unmitigated epidemic (*i.e.*, no intervention), and then interventions combining  social distancing and shielding to decrease transmission.
- We estimate predicted peak counts and timing for `r params$location` in new symptomatic cases and deaths (incidence), as well as peaks in daily hospital demand (prevalence). We also calculate totals for these values, and compute the impact of the interventions relative to an unmitigated epidemic.
- The totals for hospital demand are calculated in terms of person-days, which can be translated into the total required expenditure on hospital care.
- Population and demography is specific to `r params$location` and we use estimated contact patterns, and assume a single national population.
- Parameters of the model are from epidemics primarily from Asia, Europe, and North America.
- Severity rates are rescaled from the global setting. We assume that due to comorbidities, lower-middle income populations will have less benefit from age and will in general have higher rates of symptomatic disease.
- We start the epidemic simulation with 50 initial infections, proportionally distributed according to the age demography of `r params$location`. We refer to this as the *initial introduction*, and it corresponds roughly to when there were roughly 50 active infections in `r params$location`. This has been estimated using a correction for under-reporting and cannot be directly determined from reported cases.
- These reports will be updated as information changes, and if `r params$location`-specific information on hospitalisation rates become available.
- All numerical results are reported to two significant figures only, and are reported as interquartile range (IQR) and 95% intervals.
- Detailed modelling methods are given at the end of the report.

# Unmitigated COVID-19 Epidemic Trajectory

The panels in Fig. \@ref(fig:tsunmit) show aggregate and by-age group outcomes for daily incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in `r params$location`, and daily demand for hospital care. The ranges for peak timing and values for those outcomes is summarised in Table \@ref(tab:unpeakstable) (by IQR (50% interval) and 95% intervals); Table \@ref(tab:uncumulative1) covers total counts by `r pasteAnd(milestones/30)` months from initial introduction in `r params$location`.

In an unmitigated epidemic, we anticipate that in `r params$location`, one year after the initial introduction, the total number of symptomatic cases will have been `r bullettext(outcomesc[compartment == "cases"])`, the total deaths `r bullettext(outcomesc[compartment == "death_o"])`, and total hospitalised person-days `r bullettext(outcomesc[compartment == "hosp_p"])` with `r bullettext(outcomesc[compartment == "icu_p"])` of those person-days requiring critical care facilities.

# Intervention Scenarios

The panels in Fig. \@ref(fig:tsintervention) compare unmitigated epidemics with 5 different potential interventions in `r params$location`. The IQR and 95% intervals for peak timing and values for those outcomes is summarised in Table \@ref(tab:intpeakstable). Fig. \@ref(fig:cumtsint) shows the relative trajectories in total outcomes, with Table \@ref(tab:intcumulative1) covers cumulative reductions due to the interventions at `r pasteAnd(milestones/30)` months from initial introduction. Note that these reduction may rise and decline with time: as Fig. \@ref(fig:cumtsint) shows, some interventions have large initial impact by delaying an epidemic, but ultimately many of the cases still occur.

- We assumed these interventions are applied at the country level.
- General physical distancing was implemented as a reduction in contacts, and thus transmission, for all interactions outside the household. We assumed no change in transmission within the household.
- Greenzone shielding (abbreviated "GZ") was implemented by stratifying the population in one shielded and one unshielded compartment. The GZ applies to those aged 60+ years. We assume shielding of this population has a coverage fraction, and reduction fraction; we refer to GZ interventions by coverage / reduction, so "80C-80R shielding" is 80% coverage with 80% contact reduction to the shielded group. Other results available upon request. In `r params$location`, 80% coverage corresponds to `r mk(params$poppyra[age == "60+", sum(pop)*.8])` individuals  or `r mk(params$poppyra[age == "60+", round(unique(per_by_age)*.8*100)])`% of the population, with half of those values for 40% coverage.
- To be effective, shielding must be maintained until the epidemic is over and must ensure that there is not substantially increased mixing amongst the shielded population.
- We consider several interventions combined with "basic Public Health & Social Measures (PHSM)". PHSM is a 20% reduction in general contacts outside the home and a 25% reduction in transmission from symptomatic individuals corresponding to symptomatic people being encouraged to self-isolate.

The % net reduction to cases, deaths, and hospitalised person-days in these scenarios, one year after initial introduction in `r params$location` is summarised in Table \@ref(tab:intsumtabl):

# Methods, data and assumptions

We used the stochastic age-structured dynamic transmission model reported in [@davies2020].

## Dynamic transmission model 

We used a stochastic compartmental model stratified into 5-year age bands, with individuals classified according to current disease status (Fig. \@ref(fig:modelpars))) and transmission between groups based on social mixing patterns [@daviesage2020;@mossong2008social]. After infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the model, susceptible individuals pass through a latent period before becoming infectious, either with a preclinical and then clinical infection, or with a subclinical infection, before recovery or isolation. We refer to those infections causing few or no symptoms as subclinical. We assume older individuals are more likely to show clinical symptoms [@daviesage2020].

```{r modelpars, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.cap=sprintf("Population Structure%s", ifelse(is.na(params$is_analogy), "", paste0("; contact matrix based on ",params$is_analogy))) }

```

## Key model parameters 

As documented in [@davies2020], we collated multiple sources of evidence to estimate key model parameters. In a meta-analysis, we estimated that the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, was 2.7 (95% credible interval: 1.6–3.9) across settings without substantial control measures in place ($R_0$ describes the average number of secondary infections caused by a typical primary infection in a completely susceptible population). We derived age-stratified case fatality ratios (CFR) to estimate a CFR that ranged substantially across age groups, from 0.1% in the 20–29 age group to 7.7% in the over-80 age group.

## Key parameters of the transmission model 

We used a serial interval of 6.5 days based on published studies [@li2020early;@bi2020epidemiology;@nishiura2020serial], and assumed that the length of the preclinical period was 30% of the total period of clinical infectiousness [@liu2020contribution]. From this, we fixed the mean of the latent period to 4 days, the mean duration of preclinical infectiousness to 1.5 days, and the mean duration of clinical infectiousness to 3.5 days. The basic reproduction number $R_0$ was estimated by synthesizing the results of a literature review (Fig. S1 in [@davies2020]). For each reported value of the basic reproduction number, we matched a flexible PERT distribution (a shifted beta distribution parameterised by minimum, maximum, and mode) to the median and confidence interval reported in each study. We sampled from the resulting distributions, weighting each study equally, to obtain estimates of $R_0$ for our simulations. The age-specific clinical fraction, $y_i$, was adopted from an estimate based on case data from 6 countries [@daviesage2020], and the relative infectiousness of subclinical cases, $f$, was assumed to be 50% relative to clinical cases, as assumed in a previous study [@daviesage2020].

## Hospital burden estimation

To calculate ICU and non-ICU beds in use through time, we scaled age-stratified symptomatic cases by age-specific hospitalisation and critical outcome probability, then summed to get the total number of hospitalised and critical cases. We then distributed hospitalised cases over time based on expected time of hospitalisation and duration admitted. We assumed gamma-distributed delays, with the shape parameter set equal to the mean, for: delay from symptom onset to hospitalisation of mean 7 days (standard deviation 2.65) [@linton2020incubation;@cao2020trial]; delay from hospitalisation to discharge / death for non-ICU patients of mean 8 days (s.d. 2.83) [@NHSDigital]; delay from hospitalisation to discharge / death for ICU patients of mean 10 days (s.d. 3.16) [@cao2020trial]; and delay from onset to death of mean 22 days (s.d. 4.69) [@linton2020incubation;@cao2020trial]. We calculated the age-specific case fatality ratio based on data from the COVID-19 outbreak in China and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. We first calculated the naive case fatality ratio, nCFR, (*i.e.* deaths/cases) for each age group, then scaled down the naive CFR based on a correction factor estimated from data from the Diamond Princess [@russell2020] to give an adjusted CFR. We then calculated risk of hospitalisation based on the ratio of severe and critical cases to cases (18.5%) and deaths to cases (2.3%) in the early China data, which we took to imply 8.04 times more hospitalisations than deaths in each age group. We assumed all age groups had a 30% risk of requiring critical care if hospitalised [@cao2020trial].

## Severity Shift

To account for increased prevalence of comorbidities in lower-middle income countries, we shifted the age-specific outcome probabilities by ten years. *E.g.*, the 0-4 year old category in our model has the same risk of disease as we estimated elsewhere for 10-14 year olds. We also applied a 1.5 relative risk modifier to the case fatality ratio, this has the net effect of increasing the death rates relative to hospitalisation rated and infections.
